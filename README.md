# Real-Time-Environmental-Quality-Monitoring-Dashboard-Pipeline
Implemented a real-time environmental quality monitoring pipeline that collects sensor data, processes it through an automated data workflow, and visualizes key air-quality metrics in an interactive dashboard. The system supports continuous monitoring, historical trend analysis, and configurable alerts for threshold exceedances.
